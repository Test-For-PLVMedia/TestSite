### About

In the Beginner section of After Effects you will learn how to use Keyframes, apply Keyframes to effects, Keyframe position, size, and rotation. You will also learn how to make an optimal composition for whatever you're designing.

### Keyframing

Before we dive into how to set keyframes and how to add cool transitions onto them you need to know how we use keyframes and what they are used for. The specific use of a keyframe is to animate either a Effect or preset overtime. You can move an object to a different part of the composition over a specific amount of time. Watch the video [Here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/16FxaEFOHqL3FkwYwj78kSPjlF4RKJTjf/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1646472726650334&usg=AOvVaw1SSB-FCHavXs9iAgSFO-I5)! Showing how to make simple keyframes to change size position and rotation, if you want to follow along watch the keyboard overlay!

### Rotation keyframing

Above i showed you general Keyframing for everything, this one will specifically be based on rotation of objects shapes etc. Follow along [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0ZW3AjIYJMnCPE4o-1nEFk68wbwPvAM/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1646472726650693&usg=AOvVaw3lwtI2N6nmZ5sRTpyf8Ila) to learn more about rotation.

Presets in Saber- you have a wide variety of presets that can be used inside the one effect itself where you can change the size, color, texture and or the way the effect moves. Using the keyframe watch located in the corner you can change the Intensity glow color, glow bias and glow size over time. you have the ability to millions of different possibilities once you are able to understand how keyframes work.

you will be learning how to edit the card template i have made for any sport you want.

First go into the server, open the guide folder, go into after effects, then open the card template file. The first thing we will be changing is the color of the card. It's originally the maroon for monarch's color at the moment so I will be changing it to titan blue! to change the back of the cards color you need to open the front of card Pre composition, then you need to change the very bottom solid into whatever color you want. You can do so without creating a new
